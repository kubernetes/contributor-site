# Kubernetes Contributor Site

This repository contains the [Hugo][hugo] site and generator scripts for the
Kubernetes Contributor site. The published website is available at
https://kubernetes.dev/ (served via Netlify).

## Site content

The content for the Contributor Site is sourced from multiple locations.
Content managed within this repository is generated from generated from [Markdown]
found within the [`content`][ct] directory. To update the site's content,
make changes to the Markdown sources and [submit a pull request][pr] to this
repository.

Some content is externally sourced and changes to that must be made in the
original location. A list of sources and their locations within the
[`content`][ct] is available below:

### External sources

- **Source:** https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/guide <br>
  **Destination:** `/guide`
- **Source:** https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md <br>
  **Destination:** `/code-of-conduct.md`
- **Source:** https://git.k8s.io/sig-release/releases/release-1.18/README.md <br>
  **Destination:** `/release.md`

## Running the site locally

To develop site content, you can run the site locally using [Hugo][hugo] in
two ways:

1. [Inside a Docker container](#using-docker)
2. [Natively](#natively) (not inside a Docker container)

When you make changes to the site's content, Hugo will automatically update
the site and refresh your browser window.

### Using Docker

The easiest and most cross-system-compatible way to run the Contributor
Site is to use [Docker][docker]. To begin, create the docker image to be used
with generating the site by executing `make container-image`.

To ensure you can view the site with externally sourced content, run
`make container-gen-content` before previewing the site by with
`make container-server`.


### Natively

For instructions on installing and using Hugo, see the [Hugo Documentation][hugo-docs].
Note that the extended version is required.

In addition to Hugo, the [postcss-cli] and [autoprefixer] JavaScript packages are
required. These can be installed via the [Node Package Manager] (`npm`) from a
recent version of [nodejs] with `npm install -g postcss-cli autoprefixer`.

The Contributor Site uses the [docsy] theme. It is included as a [git submodule].
To fetch docsy and it's requirements, run the command:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1
```

To ensure you can view the site with externally sourced content, run
`make gen-content` before previewing the site by with `make server`.

**NOTE to OSX Users**

 The `hack/gen-content.sh` script requires the gnu version
of base packages such as `find`, `grep`, and `sed`. 
```
brew install coreutils findutils grep gnu-sed gnu-tar make readlink
```
You will then need to update your path to include these:
```
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
```
