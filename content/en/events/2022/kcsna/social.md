Contributors will be able to bring a single family member or  partner to the
Social. This does not include coworkers or casual friends; our intention is
to support domestic partners and close family of contributors by including
them.

**NOTE:** Guests must adhere to all KubeCon health & safety requirements.

To bring a guest, please email community@kubernetes.io with their information by October 17th.
