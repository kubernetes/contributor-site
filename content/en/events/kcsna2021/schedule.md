### Format

For this year's summit, we will have a small talk track and a large unconference
track. 

#### Unconference details

Unlike most unconferences where the attendees decide on topics the day of, we
ask that all topics are proposed, voted on, confirmed, and scheduled ahead of
time to ensure a smooth hybrid event.

We will use the open spaces facilitation style for unconference sessions at the
summit. If you are unfamiliar with the unconference format, especially open
spaces and dot voting, please refer to [this Wikipedia article] to understand
the process.
