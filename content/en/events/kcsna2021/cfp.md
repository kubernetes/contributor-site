### Notes

Unconference discussion topics will be held in an open spaces format. A
moderator will be on hand to ensure that remote attendee participation is
facilitated with the in-person discussion, but the discussion will be driven by
the people that are part of the open space. If you are unfamiliar with
unconference and the open spaces format, see [Schedule] for more information.
