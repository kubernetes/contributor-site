### When is the summit taking place?

The in-person location at the
<a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/laxjw-jw-marriott-los-angeles-la-live/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
JW Marriott LA Live</a>, a 5 minute walk away from the LA Convention Center. See
the [Location & Venue] section for more information.

[Location & Venue]: /events/kcsna2021/location/


### Will I be able to attend remotely?

Yes! We are planning a full hybrid event that **should** allow those
participating remotely to interact and work with contributors on-site. We will
post more details on how this will work closer to the event.


### Why is vaccination required to attend in-person?

As a co-located event, the summit is required to adhere to KubeCon’s
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/attend/health-and-safety/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
Health & Safety Guidelines</a>. There may be additional restrictions that
develop closer to the event, and we will update the event accordingly to follow
venue, municipality and CDC guidelines at a minimum.



### Why do I need to be a Kubernetes Org member to attend in-person?

With uncertain attendance and staffing, we made this decision to ensure we can
put on an event to the best of our ability.

Kubernetes Orgs:
- [kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes)
- [kubernetes-client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client)
- [kubernetes-csi](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi)
- [kubernetes-sigs](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs)

If you are not yet a member, but active within the project, please consider
joining! The process of joining is straight forward. See our [org membership]
docs for more information.

[org membership]: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md#member


### What is a sponsored attendee?

**NOTE:** This applied to attending in person only. Anyone may register and
attend remotely.

If you are a SIG lead or subproject owner and there is someone that is not yet
an org member or from another project that might take part of a panel,
SIG face-to-face meeting etc, you can sponsor them to attend the summit.
Please reach out to community@kubernetes.io to make arrangements.


### I am not an Org member. Can I still attend?

You can participate remotely. We are limiting the in-person event to
[Kubernetes Org Members](#why-is-vaccination-required-to-attend-in-person) and
[sponsored attendees](#what-is-a-sponsored-attendee) due to uncertain attendance
and on-site staffing availability. 


### Will there be a New Contributor Workshop?

No, with uncertain attendance and staffing, we made this decision to ensure we
can put on an event to the best of our ability. For those that are interested
in becoming a contributor, SIG ContribEx plans to launch a course later this year.
