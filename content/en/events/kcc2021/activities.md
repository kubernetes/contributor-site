## Events

### Kubernetes Contributor Awards

Kubernetes SIG Co-Chairs and Tech Leads would like for you to attend this special
event where we honor and dedicate the hard work that the community has been
working on. These peer awards are a tradition at the Kubernetes Contributor
Summits so we are bringing them virtual, please join us to thank and support all
the people who have worked hard to help us this year.

### Most Extreme Kubernetes Challenge - DevOps Party Game

DevOps Party Games takes the idea of “online party games” and tilts it on its
head by adding DevOps-inspired content to existing games, and then streams it
live via Twitch for a worldwide audience to watch, comment, and hopefully be
entertained. In addition, the hosts (Matt Stratton, Jeremy Meiss, and Dan Maher)
will provide color commentary, much like a modern day Cotton McKnight and
Pepper Brooks (announcers from Dodgeball).” There will be a Kubernetes slant
for this edition of DevOps Party Games.

 ### Cloud Native Community Cookbook - Kiwi Hackbach Edition
 
Hippie's [Hackbach](hackbach.nz) will be cooking up a couple recipes from our
[Cloud Native Community Cookbook](https://github.com/cncf/cloud-native-community-cookbook)...
and in true open-source style, everyone is encouraged to cook along in your own kitchen!
From one of the many existing recipes, or add you own (via a PR of course)! We hope is to
create a new release of the cookbook and send physical copy it out to the folks in attendance.

### Krafternetes

All day December 16th, creative folks will be showing up in the Krafternetes 
channel on Discord to share art, music, and performances. Between studio tours, 
a collaborative "quick draw" session, or online performances, the artists of
Kubernetes will have events all day to share with you.  If you're interested in
participating, speak up in channel Krafternetes on [slack].

### Kubernetes the Tabletop RPG

Comms go to static, and all you can see is a blinding red flash meaning this space 
ship is now in HIGH_ALERT. Will you and the rest of the crew make it off this 
asteroid mining hauler alive? @lauralorenz is GMing a Contributor Summit special 
one-shot of the Tabletop RPG "Mothership". And you just know that in this sci-fi 
_horror_ fantasy world, all life support and warp systems are running on k8s version 
1.23 -- which wouldn't be as scary if the game world wasn't in the year 2491. No 
tabletop roleplaying experience required, 6 players maximum, PG-13 content and 2 
hour timebox. You will need access to voice and 2 d10 die (or use the dice widget 
on Google search). [Sign up here] for Thursday or Friday night sessions.
