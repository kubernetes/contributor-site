### When is the summit taking place?

April 18th, the first day of [KubeCon Europe].

[KubeCon Europe]: https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/

### Where is the summit located?

The in-person location at the
<a href="https://www.rai.nl/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RAI Amsterdam</a>,
See the [Location & Venue] section for more information.

[Location & Venue]: /events/2023/kcseu/location/

### Will I be able to attend remotely?

No, based on our experience with Kubecon NA 2021, we do not expect to be able
to support remote access for this event.

### Why is vaccination required to attend in-person?

As a co-located event, the summit is required to adhere to KubeConâ€™s
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/attend/health-and-safety/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
Health & Safety Guidelines</a>. There may be additional restrictions that
develop closer to the event, and we will update the event accordingly to follow
venue, municipality and CDC guidelines at a minimum.

### Do I need to wear a mask?

Masks are recommended, but not required for event attendees.

### Why do I need to be a Kubernetes Org member to attend in-person?

We welcome everyone to start contributing to the project, but with 1600+
Kubernetes Org members and limited space and budget requirements we've
made the decision to limit attendance to those that are already actively
engaged with the project.

If you are not yet a member, but active within the project, please consider
joining! The process of joining is straight forward. See our [org membership]
docs for more information. If your application to join is pending, please
contact us at community@kubernetes.io about registering.

### What is a sponsored attendee?

If you are a SIG lead or subproject owner and there is someone that is not yet
an org member or from another project that might take part in a panel,
SIG face-to-face meeting etc, you can sponsor them to attend the summit.
Please [email us] to make arrangements.

### I have an idea for a session

Most of the Summit will be unconference-style, so you will have an opportunity
to propose a session closer to the Summit itself. If you have an idea for a talk,
workshop or panel please post your idea to the unconference issue or the CFP
form once they become available.  

### My SIG wants to meet at the Summit

We do not know yet if we will be able to request additional space outside of
the colo event space on Tuesday, April 18th. We will update this page and send
out community wide messages about it once the details are available.

### Will there be a doc sprint?

Yes, SIG-Docs plans to hold a Doc Sprint at the Summit, which will run for the
full day from 11am to 5pm.

### Will there be a New Contributor Workshop?

No, they are very time, person and resource intensive. We encourage those
interested in becoming a contributor to use the New Contributor Course 
slated to launch later this year.

or partner to the social (a "plus one").
