# Contributor Social

We are still reviewing locations, but should have more info soon! You can expect good food, fun activities and of course, the best company!


## Bringing A Guest

Contributors will be able to bring a single family member or 
partner to the Social.  This does not include coworkers or casual friends;
our intention is to support domestic partners and close family of contributors
by including them.  

Guests must be fully vaccinated and adhere to all other KubeCon health & 
safety requirements.

If you would like to bring a guest, [please fill out the request form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/kccseu22social).

If you have questions about guests,
then [contact us](mailto:community@cncf.io).
