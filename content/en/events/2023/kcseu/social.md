# Contributor Social

We are still reviewing locations, but should have more info soon! You can expect good food, fun activities and of course, the best company!

## Activities

Games!  Prizes!

Lachlan Evenson will lead a live pub quiz of Kubernetes trivia.  Play alone'
or in teams; the winning team/player will get prizes.

Contributors are urged to bring boardgames with them to the Social.  The venue
has many small tables perfect for playing games with a few other contributors.

For first-time Contributor Summit attendees, we'll also have Bingo Cards
intended to help you break the ice with more experienced contributors. The
first folks to complete vertical row, horizontal row, and blackout on their 
bingo cards will win prizes.

## Food & Drink

La Casa Del Mar serves American-Spanish hybrid pub food, and we'll have substantial
snacks available for all contributors, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic 
drinks.

## Bringing A Guest

Contributors will be able to bring a single family member or 
partner to the Social.  This does not include coworkers or casual friends;
our intention is to support domestic partners and close family of contributors
by including them.  

Guests must be fully vaccinated and adhere to all other KubeCon health & 
safety requirements.
