**NOTE:** You must go through vaccine verification and pick up your badge before
attending the summit or social evening event.

## Steering AMA

The Summit will start off with an AMA with members of the Kubernetes Steering
Committee.  Bring any and all questions about how we're running the project,
ongoing efforts & issues, and whatever you'd like to discuss with Steering.

## Unconference

The Contributor Summit will be an [Unconference-style event](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/08/30/henrikkniberg/what-is-an-unconference).  This means that
you should arrive with topics in mind, and we will pitch them and vote on them
in the morning, and then hold sessions in the afternoon, after the Steering AMA.
This is the format used at many [DevOps Days](https://devopsdays.org/open-space-format/), and helps us accommodate changing 
needs and unpredictable travel schedules.

If you have a topic in mind, hold on to it for just a bit longer. A collection issue / form will be launched soon!

## SIG Meetings

SIGs, Working Groups, and teams will be meeting during the Summit.  See if your
team is meeting and mark your attendance on our 
[SIG Meetings Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LS1q4VJajZkNZODdMnJ4eH3XnTsE_4em6pjQgToHyfw/edit?usp=sharing).

## Doc Sprint

SIG-Docs will have a full-day Documentation working session during the Summit.
If you contribute to the docs -- and who doesn't -- or you want to learn to
do it better, join them.
