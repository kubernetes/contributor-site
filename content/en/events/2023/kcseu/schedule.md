**NOTE:** You must go through vaccine verification and pick up your badge before
attending the summit or social evening event.

## Steering AMA

The Summit will start off with an AMA with members of the Kubernetes Steering
Committee.  Bring any and all questions about how we're running the project,
ongoing efforts & issues, and whatever you'd like to discuss with Steering.

## Unconference

The Contributor Summit will be primarily an [Unconference-style event](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/08/30/henrikkniberg/what-is-an-unconference).  This means that
you should arrive with topics in mind, and we will pitch them and vote on them
in the morning, and then hold sessions in the afternoon, after the Steering AMA.
This is the format used at many [DevOps Days](https://devopsdays.org/open-space-format/), and helps us accommodate changing 
needs and unpredictable travel schedules.

If you have a topic in mind, please add it to the [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/7157).

## Doc Sprint

SIG-Docs will have a full-day Documentation working session during the Summit.
If you contribute to the docs -- and who doesn't -- or you want to learn to
do it better, join them.

## CFP

If you would like to submit a formal session, please use the [CFP Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1z7TnjixN9fiuQulF-EU9rw7_U9I-I8HNOv28IAFsHZc/viewform).
This form will be open through Friday, March 31st, and covers presentation, workshop, and collaboration style sessions.  
Unconference sessions should use the GitHub issue referenced above.
