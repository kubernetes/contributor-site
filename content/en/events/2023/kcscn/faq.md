### Will I be able to attend remotely?

No, based on our experience with Kubecon NA 2021, we do not expect to be able
to support remote access for this event.

### What are the Health and Safety protocols?

As a co-located event, the summit is required to adhere to KubeCon’s
<a href="https://www.lfasiallc.com/kubecon-cloudnativecon-open-source-summit-china/attend/health-safety/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
Health & Safety Guidelines</a>. There may be additional restrictions that
develop closer to the event, and we will update the event accordingly to follow
venue, municipality and local guidelines at a minimum.

### Priority Registration Notice: Org Members for Contributor Summit

Certainly, we need to specify that if the number of registrations is too high,
priority may be given to community members for attendance. While we welcome
active participation from a wide range of community members, due to limited resources,
we may give higher priority to community members in terms of attendance.
This helps ensure the quality and level of engagement of the event while also
offering more opportunities to those who have been contributing to the community.
We will strive to ensure fairness and inclusivity in the event to the best of our abilities.
Thank you for your understanding and support.

This year etcd org members, or those who contribute a lot to etcd, are also eligible for priority registration,
as [etcd is expected to soon become a Kubernetes SIG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/7372).

### I have an idea for a session

Most of the Summit will be unconference-style, so you will have an opportunity
to propose a session closer to the Summit itself. If you have an idea for a talk,
workshop or panel please post your idea to the unconference issue or the CFP
form once they become available.  

### Will there be a New Contributor Workshop?

No, they are very time, person and resource intensive. We encourage those
interested in becoming a contributor to use the New Contributor Course 
slated to launch later this year.
