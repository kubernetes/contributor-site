Contributor Summits bring together new and current Kubernetes contributors to
connect and learn from one another. It is an opportunity for existing contributors
to help shape the future of the project, and offers a welcoming space for new
community members to learn, explore and put the contributor workflow to practice.

In some sense, Contributor Summits are a real-life extension of the community
and SIG meetings. They aim to:

- Onboard new contributors to be productive in our community
- Send contributors home with more context, knowledge, and skills about the project
- Facilitate SIG-specific face-to-face collaboration
