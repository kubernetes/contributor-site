### About

Grab your lunch and come join the [Kubernetes Meet and Greet]! This event is for SIGs and WGs, new and experienced contributors. We will have representatives from many SIG / WG to answer questions and talk more about how to get involved.

The Kubernetes M&G is for both:

- Experienced Kubernetes contributors who are interested in expanding their involvement in new SIGs / WGs, or just hanging out with their SIG/WG collaborators.
- New contributors who are looking for where they can contribute to Kubernetes

### Details

The [Kubernetes Meet and Greet] will take place on Wednesday, March 25, from noon to 3pm, in the Europe Foyer.

### Instructions for New Contributors

Please grab your lunch in the main exhibit hall.  Then proceed over to the Europe Foyer, enter the room, and look for one or more SIGs, WGs, or other teams that seem like something you'll be interested in.  Sit down, and ask them about their SIG/WG.

Note that SIGs and WGs will share tables, with more than one at a table.  If you have trouble finding the group you want, there will be a volunteer from SIG-Contrbutor Experience to guide you to the right table.

### Instructions for SIG Members and Current Contributors

Please grab your lunch in the main exhibit hall.  Then proceed over to the Europe Foyer, enter the room, and look for your SIG/WG, or the one where you want to discuss contributions.  

It may be that you are the first member of your SIG/WG to arrive. In that case, take the sign and the bag of SIG pins and find an empty table, or a table with sufficient space for another SIG to join.  When all members of your SIG depart, please pack up the pins and sign, and return them to ContribEx.

SIG members are not expected to stay the entire 3 hours.  Instead, pick a period of one to two hours where you can staff the table.
