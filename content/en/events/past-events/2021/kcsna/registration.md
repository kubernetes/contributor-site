As we are not holding the formal Contributor Summit, we are not running
conference registration. SIGs and subprojects who choose to hold a mini-event
will be responsible for any kind of signups they need to manage.

We **will** be holding an evening social event, however, and have an RSVP link
for attendees. To attend the social, you must be a member or active contributor
of one of the Kubernetes GitHub Orgs (e.g., [kubernetes] or [kubernetes-sigs]) or
a sponsored attendee. If you are an active contributor but not a member, consider
[applying for org membership]!

If you have questions, please see the [faq] or reach out to us at
community@kubernetes.io.

**Registration is currently closed.**

**NOTE:** Any in-person events held by SIGs and subprojects will follow KubeCon’s
[Health & Safety Guidelines] requiring **ALL** in-person attendees to be fully
vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus.
