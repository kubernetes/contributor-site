# Contributor Social at La Casa Del Mar

<img align="right" src="/events/kcseu/casadelmar.jpg" width="30%">

From 6:30 to 8:30pm (and beyond), Kubernetes contributors will be schmoozing,
eating, playing boardgames, and competing in a pub quiz at [La Casa Del Mar](https://lacasadelamar.com/espacios-patacona/), 
a cafe and bar by the beach in Valencia.

The Social is open only to registered attendees of the Kubernetes Contributor
Summit and possibly their guests (see below).  You must be [registered](https://cvent.me/384mb9)
before attending.

## Information Form

Please help us plan a better social [by filling out our form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/kccseu22social).

## Location And Transportation

The Contributor Social will be held at the
<a href="https://lacasadelamar.com/espacios-patacona/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">La Casa de la Mar</a>
several kilometers from the Feria.

As such, a bus will leave from The Fira (conference venue) at 6pm on May 16th
to take contributors to the Social.  The bus will return after 8:30pm.

Some contributors will leave from their hotels; if you want to share a cab from
your hotel or another location, 
[sign up on the cab-sharing sheet](https://bit.ly/cseu22carpools).

You are also welcome to get there on your own.  There aren't any good public 
transportation links to the venue.

## Activities

Games!  Prizes!

Lachlan Evenson will lead a live pub quiz of Kubernetes trivia.  Play alone'
or in teams; the winning team/player will get prizes.

Contributors are urged to bring boardgames with them to the Social.  The venue
has many small tables perfect for playing games with a few other contributors.

For first-time Contributor Summit attendees, we'll also have Bingo Cards
intended to help you break the ice with more experienced contributors. The
first folks to complete vertical row, horizontal row, and blackout on their 
bingo cards will win prizes.

## Food & Drink

La Casa Del Mar serves American-Spanish hybrid pub food, and we'll have substantial
snacks available for all contributors, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic 
drinks.

## Bringing A Guest

If we have room, contributors will be able to bring a single family member or 
partner to the Social.  We will not know if we have room until May 10th.  

If you would like to bring a guest, [please fill out the Social form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/kccseu22social).

If you have questions about guests (such as wanting to bring children as well),
then [contact us](mailto:community@cncf.io).
