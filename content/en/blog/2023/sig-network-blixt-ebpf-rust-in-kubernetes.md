In [SIG Network][signet] we now have a layer 4 (“L4”) load balancer named [Blixt][blixt]. This
project started as a fun experiment using emerging technologies and is intended
to become a utility for CI and testing to help facilitate the continued
development of [Gateway API][gwapi]. Are you interested in developing networking
tools in [Rust][rust] and [eBPF][ebpf]? Or perhaps you're specifically
interested in Gateway API? We'll tell you a bit about the project and how it
might benefit you.

## History

[Blixt][blixt] originated at [Kong][kong] as an experiment to test
load-balancing ingress traffic for Kubernetes clusters using eBPF for the
dataplane. Around the time of Kubecon Detroit (2022) we (the [Gateway
API][gwapi] maintainers) realized it had significant potential to help us move
our TCPRoute and UDPRoute support forward, which had been sort of "stuck in
alpha" at the time due to a lack of conformance tests being developed for them.
At the same time, various others in the SIG Network community developed an
interest in the project due to the rapid growth of eBPFs use on Kubernetes.
Given the potential for benefit to the Kubernetes ecosystem and the growing
interest, Kong decided it would be helpful to [donate the project to Kubernetes
SIGs][donation] to benefit upstream Kubernetes.

Over several months we rewrote the project in [Rust][rust] (from C), due to a
strong contingency of Rust knowledge (and interest) between us developing the
project and an active interest in the burgeoning [Aya project][aya] (a Rust
framework for developing eBPF programs). We did eventually move the
control plane (specifically) to [Golang][go] however, so that we could take
advantage of the [Kubebuilder][kb] and [controller-runtime][ctrl] ecosystems.
Additionally, we augmented our custom program loader (in eBPF, you generally
write _loaders_ that load your BPF byte code into the kernel) with
[bpfman][bpfman]: a project adjacent to us in the Rust + eBPF ecosystem, which
helps solve several security and ergonomic problems with managing BPF programs on
Linux systems.

After the recently completed [license review process][lrev], which provided a blanket
exception for the use of dual licensed eBPF in CNCF code, the project
became officially part of Kubernetes and interest has been growing. We have several
goals for the project which revolve around the continued development of Gateway
API, with a specific focus on helping mature Layer 4 support (e.g. the UDPRoute
and TCPRoute API kinds).

## Goals

Currently the high level goal of the project is to provide a [Gateway
API][gwapi] driven load-balancer for non-production use cases. Those
non-production use cases include:

- Driving conformance tests and adoption for L4 use cases.
- Using this implementation as part of the Gateway API CI testing strategy.
- Having the Blixt control-plane be a reference implementation.
- Exploring issues associated with the generic use of eBPF in Kubernetes.

In support of those goals we have some more specific sub-goals we're actively
working towards:

- Support [GatewayClass][gwc] and [Gateway][gw], meeting [conformance
  requirements][gwconf]
- Support [UDPRoute][urt] and [TCPRoute][trt], meanwhile helping to develop the
  conformance requirements for these APIs.

We have some significant progress on the above in that we have a **basic**
level of support for creating a GatewayClass and at least one Gateway, and
then attaching UDPRoute and TCPRoute resources to that Gateway. Doing that drives a
process of the underlying data plane
receiving corresponding configuration and traffic then flowing as expected. We
emphasize the **basic**: as the project is still quite early on, and being
developed in a highly iterative fashion. That said the fundamentals are there
and you can try them out yourself on a local system using our [usage
documentation][usage] and [sample configurations][samples]. You can see more
about the project's [current status on the README.md][status] including the
milestones and current progress.

One thing that can't be overstated about this project is that it has been at the
center of a lot of learning, community building and fun. We have maintained a
policy with this project that it shall never be intended for production use
cases which means development of the project is more of a sandbox and a safe
space for people to learn and experiment. If any of this sounds interesting to
you, now is a great time to get involved!

## Getting involved

If you're interested in networking, Rust, Linux, eBPF (or all of the above)
there's a lot of opportunity here to learn and have fun. We invite you to jump
right in on the [repository][repo] if that's your style, or reach out to us in
the community: You can reach us on [Kubernetes Slack][k8slack] on the
`#sig-network-gateway-api` channel as well as the `#ebpf` channel. Blixt is a
topic of discussion at the [Gateway API community meetings][meets], and the
monthly [SIG Network Code Jam][cjam] as well.
