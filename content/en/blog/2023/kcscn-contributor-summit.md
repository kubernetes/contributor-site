After a three-year hiatus, the Linux Foundation and Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)
are thrilled to announce the return of
[KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit China 2023](https://www.lfasiallc.com/kubecon-cloudnativecon-open-source-summit-china/program/schedule/)
in the vibrant city of Shanghai, often referred to as the Oriental Pearl. The first day of the summit
will be dedicated to all Kubernetes contributors, recognizing their countless days and nights of hard work,
the lines of code they have submitted, and the wonderful sparks of ideas that have shaped the prosperity
and glory of the kubernetes community through continuous technical exchanges.

Today, developers from around the world come together in this dreamlike city of the East.
The organizing committee has meticulously prepared exquisite food and drinks,
complemented by exclusive topics, as a tribute to the contributions and efforts made by
contributors in the past, present, and future. Our hearts brim with gratitude.

bring new energy and ideas, we extend a sincere invitation to register for this contributor summit.
