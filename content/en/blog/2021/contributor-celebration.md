More deatils on [how to join](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/kcc2021/how-to-join/) the event 

### Events and Activities
1. [**DevOps Party Games**](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/kcc2021/activities/#most-extreme-kubernetes-challenge---devops-party-game)
 "DevOps Party Games takes the idea of "online party games" and tilts it on its head by adding DevOps-inspired content to existing games, and then streams it live via Twitch for a worldwide audience to watch, comment, and hopefully be entertained. In addition, the hosts (Matt Stratton, Jeremy Meiss, and Dan Maher) will provide color commentary, much like a modern day Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks (announcers from Dodgeball)." There will be a Kubernetes slant for this edition of DevOps Party Games.

2. **[The Great Cloud Native Bakeoff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koT08purWDc)**
    A virtual cooking event styled after the [Great British Bake-off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_British_Bake_Off) will be held during the Kubernetes celebration Event 

    Contestants will have 90 minutes to cook a Kubernetes themed dessert. Anything goes, as long as the majority of preparation is done live.  The competition is open to all skill levels, from baking from a cake mix to grinding your own flour as long as you can theme it to Kubernetes.
    Contestants will be responsible for their own recipes and acquiring their ingredients. If you need help with either of these, let us know! 
    Contestants will be expected to join a video conference call 30 mins prior to kick-off, and should have a phone or ipad with a stand (or a patient friend ) to capture them preparing their dessert.
    Our Host and Commentators will provide commentary on our contestants and will ask each contestant questions throughout the event.

    :::info
    At the end of the 90 minutes we’ll be joined by an esteemed group of expert judges who will judge your hopefully completed dessert on the following criteria:

    Execution: How well does it fit the “Kubernetes theme”
    Appearance: How does it look ?
    Taste: Obviously the judges can’t taste it, so they’ll need to be creative for this one.
    :::
    **We’re looking for cooks of all backgrounds and talents.** If this sounds like fun to you and you want to cook with us, please fill the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmvXEFsdy0NzQofp198ShzupRPc4M5yDZYfdEMYPR4qD7aCw/viewform)

3. [**Kubernetes Contributor Awards**](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/kcc2021/activities/#kubernetes-contributor-awards)
     In this special event we honor and dedicate the hard work that the community has been working on. These peer awards are a tradition at the Kubernetes Contributor Summits so we are bringing them virtual, please join us to thank and support all the people who have worked hard to help us this year. 
     
4. **krafternetes**
    A series of "studio sessions" by contributors, to showcase the art forms they are working on be it through live or recorded sessions, followed by a discussion on the same. Interested folks could join the #krafternetes channel on kubernetes slack.
