<p class="lead mt-5"><b>Welcome to the Kubernetes Contributor Community</b></p>

<b>
This site is the home of contributor documentation, and serves as a starting
point for your journey as a Kubernetes contributor.

It is intended to be the hub for all things related to the Kubernetes Contributor
experience. Who exactly is a contributor? We all are--Whether youâ€™re writing docs,
reviewing code, participating in the community and its many SIGs, everyone is
welcome. We hope this site will be a pathway to success for our 35000+ Kubernetes
contributors, providing current, up-to-date information on community events,
contributor resources, Kubernetes SIGs, and more.
