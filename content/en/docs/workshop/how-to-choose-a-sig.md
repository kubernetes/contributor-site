## Goals

This document discusses how to get started working on Kubernetes. It is intended to inform you how to find where you fit.

## Community Group Types

Kubernetes is a large project. These Group Types exist to help scope the type of work being done. They also help mitigate scope creep.

Kubernetes has the following types of groups that are officially supported:

* Special Interest Groups (SIGs): Persistent open groups that focus on a part of the project.
  * Subprojects: Each SIG can have a set of subprojects. These are smaller groups that can work independently.
* Working Groups (WGs): Temporary groups that are formed to address issues that cross SIG boundaries.
* User Groups (UGs): Groups for facilitating communication and discovery of information
* Committees: Sets of people that are chartered to take on sensitive topics.

## First Steps

Go through the [Getting Started Guide on kubernetes.dev](https://www.kubernetes.dev/docs/guide/). It walks you through the steps to take to commit to the project. The document is extensive, but please don't be intimidated.

## Picking a group to work in

Where you work in the Kubernetes project depends on your skills and what you want to do with your (or your company's) time.

Anybody is welcome to jump into a SIG and begin fixing issues, critique design proposals, and review code. SIGs have regular video meetings which everyone is welcome to attend. Each SIG has a Slack channel, meeting notes, and their own documentation that is useful to read and understand.

If you're an engineer that enjoys coding, your skills will be beneficial to a lot of groups in the project.

If you're good at technical writing, you'll be able to help with a lot of groups. But, SIG-Docs is a great place to start.
