## Welcome to the E-Learning for Contributors course for Kubernetes!

Each unit of this course consists of a slideshow and links to resources. Take your time reading the materials, and feel free to reach out to the community with questions.

The Kubernetes project is always evolving. To keep this course more relevant for longer, it is built with links to other resources rather than listing explicit steps and details. This keeps the training from falling out of step with the rest of the Kubernetes project.

We look forward to your contributions!
