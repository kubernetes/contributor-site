Most community activity is organized into Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and time bounded Working Groups.

SIGs follow these [guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/governance.md) although each of these groups may operate a little differently depending on their needs and workflow.

Each group's material is in its subdirectory in this project.

When the need arises, a [new SIG can be created](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-wg-lifecycle.md)
