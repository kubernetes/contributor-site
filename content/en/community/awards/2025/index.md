#### API Machinery

*Aaron Prindle, [@aaron-prindle](https://github.com/aaron-prindle)*  
Aaron has been a driving force behind the new declarative validation framework in Kubernetes. His leadership and technical contributions to KEP-5073, which introduces validation-gen, have been instrumental in moving Kubernetes API validation from complex, handwritten Go code to a more maintainable and author-friendly declarative model. Over the last year, Aaron's work has established the foundational infrastructure for this transition, including the creation of the validation-gen code generator. This work significantly lowers the barrier for new contributors and improves the overall quality and consistency of the Kubernetes API, making it a more robust and accessible project for the entire community.

*Joel Speed, [@JoelSpeed](https://github.com/JoelSpeed)*  
We are pleased to nominate Joel Speed for his valuable contributions to the kube-api-linter project. This tool is essential for ensuring the quality and consistency of Kubernetes-style APIs, and Joel's recent work has been vital to its continued improvement. His contributions over the last year have helped enhance the linter's capabilities, making it easier for developers to identify and correct issues in their custom resources and controllers. Joel's dedication to improving the tooling around API development demonstrates a strong commitment to the health of the broader Kubernetes ecosystem and helps developers build better, more reliable extensions for Kubernetes.

*Yongrui Lin, [@yongruilin](https://github.com/yongruilin)*  
We nominate Yongrui for his significant and detailed contributions to the implementation of declarative validation in Kubernetes.
