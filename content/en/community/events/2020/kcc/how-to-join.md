[official instructions]: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started

### Connecting to the server

1) After you login to Discord, click on the **Add a server button** (The `+`
   symbol) on the left side of the application. 
   <br>
   <br>
   <img align="center" src="/community/events/past-events/2020/kcc2020/add-server.png" width="40%">
   <br>
   <br>
   A menu should pop up asking if you'd like to create or join a server. Select
   **Join a server**.
   <br>
   <br>
2) Copy the invite link from the "Kubernetes Contributor Celebration Invite"
   email, and paste it in the **Invite link** text box.
   <br>
   <br>
   <img align="center" src="/community/events/past-events/2020/kcc2020/join-server.png" width="40%">
   <br> 
   <br> 
3) Two things will happen: You will be directed to the `#instructions-to-connect`
   channel and you will receive a DM from our bot [YAGPDB.xyz]. The
   `#instructions-to-connect` channel contain the next steps to finish joining
   the server.
   <br>
   <br>
   <img align="center" src="/community/events/past-events/2020/kcc2020/instructions-to-connect.png" width="100%">
   <br>
   <br> 
4) The bot will dm you a unique link where you will need to complete a captcha.
   <br>
   <br>
   **NOTE:** If you did not get a dm from the bot, right click on the bot name
   (`@YAGPDB.xyz`), and select **message**. That will take you to the correct
   prompt.
   <br>
   <img align="center" src="/community/events/past-events/2020/kcc2020/dm-from-bot.png" width="100%">
   <br>
   <br>
   If you do not complete the captcha within 10 minutes, you will be booted from
   the server (you will still be able to reconnect).
   <br>
   <br>
   <img align="center" src="/community/events/past-events/2020/kcc2020/verification.png" width="100%">
   <br>
   <br>
5) After completing the captcha, navigate to the `#code-of-conduct` channel.
   There you will need to read and agree to the [Code of Conduct] by clicking
   on the Kubernetes emoji. This must be done before you can access any other
   channels within the server.
   <br>
   <br>
   <img align="center" src="/community/events/past-events/2020/kcc2020/coc.png" width="100%">
   <br>
   <br>
   <img align="center" src="/community/events/past-events/2020/kcc2020/coc-emoji.png" width="100%">
   <br> 
   <br>
   Once you accept the Code of conduct, you will see a list of categories and
   channels on the left side of the app. We have set up existing channels for
   popular games and activities, if you’re not interested in something you can
   collapse that entire section in the sidebar.
   <br>
   <br>
   <img align="center" src="/community/events/past-events/2020/kcc2020/channels.png" width="100%">
   <br> 
   <br>
   **Note:** Unlike Slack you can see every channel, and every user on the server!
   This is normal. The workflow is that you can see everything, but choose the
   categories you're interested in and mute the others.

## Tips and suggestions for using Discord

### Managing audio

You have full control of your incoming audio! You can right click on a person
in the voice room and individually assign a user volume to them. This is handy
since not everyone has the same microphone and some people might be too loud,
and some might be too soft. If you’re expecting to play with a group for a long
time this can help tremendously:

<br>

<br> 
<br>


### Sharing your screen or video

Once you’ve joined a voice channel you can use the widgets at the bottom left
of the screen to share your own screen and to use video if you want:
<br>
<br>
<img align="center" src="/community/events/past-events/2020/kcc2020/voice-video.png" width="40%">
<br> 
<br>
The _Voice connected_ text and signal meter will change depending on your
internet connection. Sometimes hanging up (clicking the phone icon with the **X**
on it) and rejoining the voice channel is useful if you have a bad connection.


### Troubleshooting your audio/video settings

If your audio or video is having an issue, you may need to alter the voice or
video settings.

1) Begin by clicking on the cog next to your Discord username in the lower left
   corner:
   <br>
   <br>
   <img align="center" src="/community/events/past-events/2020/kcc2020/settings-cog.png" width="100%">
   <br> 
   <br>
2) Navigate to the **Voice & Video** section of the User Settings to adjust your
   inputs and outputs.
   <br>
