### Will I be able to attend remotely?

No, based on our experience with Kubecon NA 2021, we do not expect to be able
to support remote access for this event.


### Why is vaccination required to attend in-person?

As a co-located event, the summit is required to adhere to KubeCon’s
<a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/attend/health-and-safety/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
Health & Safety Guidelines</a>. There may be additional restrictions that
develop closer to the event, and we will update the event accordingly to follow
venue, municipality and CDC guidelines at a minimum.

### Do I need to wear a mask?

All attendees are required to wear masks except when eating or drinking.  Eating and drinking should be kept to designated areas.

### Why do I need to be a Kubernetes Org member to attend in-person?

With uncertain attendance and staffing, we made this decision to ensure we can
put on an event to the best of our ability.

### What is a sponsored attendee?

If you are a SIG lead or subproject owner and there is someone that is not yet
an org member or from another project that might take part in a panel,
SIG face-to-face meeting etc, you can sponsor them to attend the summit.
Please [email us] to make arrangements.

### I have an idea for a session

Most of the Summit will be unconference-style, so you will have an opportunity
to propose a session the morning of the Summit.  However, we have a couple of
time slots for plenary sessions around the unconference ones, so if you have 
a topic that you think needs the whole community's attention, please [add it to
the issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/6633).

### My SIG wants to meet at the Summit

We will provide space for SIG, WG, Committee, and other Kubernetes team meetings
at the Summit.  If you think your team will want to hold one of these, please 
add your team to [the meeting schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LS1q4VJajZkNZODdMnJ4eH3XnTsE_4em6pjQgToHyfw/edit?usp=sharing).

### Will there be a doc sprint?

Yes, SIG-Docs plans to hold a Doc Sprint at the Summit, which will run for the
full day from 11am to 5pm.

### Will there be a New Contributor Workshop?

No, with uncertain attendance and staffing, we made this decision to ensure we
can put on an event to the best of our ability. For those that are interested
in becoming a contributor, SIG ContribEx plans to launch a course later this year.
